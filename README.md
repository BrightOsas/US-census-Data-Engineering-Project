# US-census-Data-Engineering-Project

## Overview
Welcome to the US Census Data Engineering project, where I analyze the United States Census Bureau's 2017 Basic Monthly CPS using Apache Spark (Python).

## Objective
* Determine the count of responders per family income range.
* Identify the top 10 counts of responders based on geographical division/location and race.
* Assess the number of responders without a telephone at home but with access elsewhere, accepting telephone interviews.
* Evaluate the number of responders with access to a telephone, but rejecting telephone interviews.


## Datasets Used:  
* December 2017 United States Census Bureauâ€™s Basic Monthly CPS Record (.dat)
* January 2017 Basic Monthly CPS Data Dictionary File (.txt)
## Process:
The project leverages Python to extract specified information from the dataset using the provided data dictionary file. Apache Spark is then employed for in-depth dataset analysis, addressing key questions outlined in the project objectives.
